#Dungeon Hunter- Game

This is a new project I started just to try out a new type of game programing.

###What's in the game?

Right now the only thing in the game is the game window. Their is a bug in the game right now that makes the player character not to spawn.

###What will be in the game?

+ A background image. (Done)
+ A player character that can only be controled up, down, right and left. Not diagonal. (Done)
+ Different dungeon levels.
+ Enemies.

###What I might will put in the game

+ Health to the player
+ Health to the enemies
+ Boss fights
+ Exp
+ Leveling
+ Skill upgrades
+ Game points
+ High score
